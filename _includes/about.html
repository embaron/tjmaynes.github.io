<div id="about">
  <p>I am a Software Engineer building iOS applications at <a href="https://www.rejuvenan.com/" target="_blank">Rejuvenan Global Health</a> in New York City. I enjoy working on open source projects, hacking on random applications for fun, and going for a hike in the great outdoors. I studied Computer Science at the University of South Florida. My projects are hosted on <a href="https://www.github.com/tjmaynes/" target="_blank">github</a>, along with my <a href="/cv.pdf">CV</a> in pdf format. The easiest way to contact me is through my email: <a href="mailto:tjmaynes@outlook.com">tjmaynes at outlook dot com</a>.
